# Workshop for CBioVikings

# Title: Interactive Data Analysis in Python with Pandas using Jupyter Notebook

**Introduction**
Data comes in many forms, shapes and flavors. As tasty and free spirited as this may sound, the diligent data analyst often spends most of her/his time preparing and wrangling the data itself, rather than running or coding a particular model or statistical test. This is where Python and Pandas come into play, providing high-level, flexible, and efficient tools for manipulating your data as needed.

**Program**
CBioVikings will get a short introduction on how to use Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebook), an interactive computational environment, which combines code execution, rich text, mathematics, plots and media. Then weâ€™ll delve right into Data Analysis using Pandas, a Python library providing easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. 

**Structure**
Introduction 30-45 min
Break 7.5 min
Exercises 30-60 min

**Prerequisites**
This evening workshop is aimed at people with basic Python skills, but "all levels" are welcome and encouraged to attend. Please install the following software before the workshop and check that it is running (or at least download it before coming).

1.) Git
https://git-scm.com/

2.) Python (2.x or 3.x), Enthought or Anaconda (Python and other commonly used packages)
https://www.python.org/
https://www.enthought.com/canopy-subscriptions/ (Canopy Express is FREE and very easy to set up --> recommended if you are new to Python/programming)
https://www.continuum.io/downloads

The following Python packages can be installed using "pip" (a Python package manager) or found at "pypi" as well as individual web-sites.
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
https://pypi.python.org/

EASY INSTALLATION using pip:
enter the following in the terminal to install multiple packages at once including all dependencies 
"pip install ipython jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn"
(n.b. if pip is not available write the following: "easy_install pip"
depending on your installation you might need to add python and pip to your environmental variables)
